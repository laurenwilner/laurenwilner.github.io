Service utilization was measured as service volume per prevalent case, while price and intensity was measured as spending per visit, admission, or prescription. Das Gupta and Shapley decomposition methods and linear regression were used to estimate the contribution of each factor. The data analysis was conducted between March 2024 and July 2024.Age, disease prevalence, service utilization, or service price and intensity.Variation in health care spending across US counties.In 2019, 76.6\% of personal health care spending was included in this study. Overall, 64.8\% of cross-county health care spending variation among 3110 US counties was explained by service utilization, while population age, disease prevalence, and price and intensity of services explained 4.1\%, 7.0\%, and 24.1\%, respectively. The rate at which these factors contributed to variation in spending differed by payer, type of care, and health condition. Service utilization was associated with insurance coverage, median income, and education. An increase in each of these from the median to the 75th percentile was associated with a 7.8\%, 4.4\%, and 3.8\% increase in ambulatory care utilization, respectively. The fraction of Medicare beneficiaries with Medicare Advantage was associated with less utilization. An increase in Medicare Advantage coverage from the median to the 75th percentile was associated with a 1.9\% decrease in ambulatory care utilization. Differences in cross-state spending levels were also attributed to different factors. For Utah, the state with the least health care spending per capita, spending rates were lower for all types of care due principally to the young age profile. For New York, the state with the highest spending, spending rates were relatively high for hospital inpatient and prescribed pharmaceutical spending. For both types of care, high service price and intensity contributed to the above-average spending.In this cross-sectional study, variation in health care spending among US counties was largely related to variation in service utilization. Understanding the drivers of spending variation in the US may help policymakers assess the allocation of health care resources.},

Children are uniquely vulnerable to CO poisoning. Power outages may increase the risk of CO exposure through improper generator use.We used community-level power outage data from 2017 to 2020 and CO emergency department visits among children \&lt;18 from the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) in New York State (NYS). We evaluated all-scale (≥1\% of a community without power) and large-scale (≥20\% of a community without power) outages and their impact on CO poisoning on the day of initial outage exposure and the 3 following days (lag day 0 through lag day 3) in a case-crossover study design.We identified 917 cases of CO poisoning and an incidence rate of 5.6 per 100 000 person-years in NYS from 2017 to 2020. The incidence rate of CO poisoning was highest among children aged 5 years or younger (7.8 per 100 0000 person-years) and among Black children (9.1 per 100 000 person-years). Four hours without power increased the odds of a pediatric CO poisoning ED visit on the day of exposure by ≥50\% for all-scale and ≥150\% for large-scale outages. Associations were stronger in urban vs rural areas.Although CO poisoning is a rare cause of pediatric ED visits in NYS, it is preventable. Outages substantially increased the odds of CO poisoning-related ED visits among children and should be regarded as an important CO poisoning risk factor.},

We used electronic health record data from 3.7 million Kaiser Permanente Southern California members to promptly determine if the 2025 LA Fires increased outpatient acute healthcare utilization. We created exposure categories using the maximum wildfire burn zone reached by an LA or Ventura County wildfire as of January 16, 2025. Highly-exposed members resided in census tracts located {\textless}20km from burn zones and moderately-exposed members lived in tracts ≥20km but within LA County. We identified daily outpatient and virtual acute care visits in five categories: all-cause, cardiovascular, injury, neuropsychiatric, and respiratory. We conducted 2-stage interrupted time-series analyses using machine-learning algorithms to determine if and by how much the 2025 LA Fires increased acute healthcare utilization. Across the week following the January 7 LA Fires ignitions, virtual respiratory visits were 41\% (95\% empirical confidence interval [eCI]: 26\%, 56\%) higher and 34\% (95\% eCI: 17\%, 52\%) higher than expected in highly- and moderately-exposed groups, respectively, totaling 3,221 excess visits. Similarly, both exposure groups had approximately 35\% more virtual cardiovascular visits than expected over the same period. Among highly-exposed members, outpatient and virtual injury visits and outpatient neuropsychiatric visits were ≥ 18\% higher than expected on January 7. Substantial increases in acute healthcare utilization driven primarily by virtual care-seeking were observed following the LA Fires. As disruptive climate events increase, such data are essential to inform healthcare preparedness and response.},

	abstract = {In the United States, severe weather-driven power outages are increasing in frequency and duration, likely with health consequences. Previous studies examined individual severe weather events (e.g., heatwaves) and focused on large outages in metropolitan areas. Here, we described nationwide spatiotemporal patterns of individual (e.g., tropical cyclone alone) and simultaneous (e.g., tropical cyclone + anomalous heat) severe weather events co-occurring with 8+ hour outages. We used hourly county-level PowerOutage.us data from 2018–2020 to define 8+ hour outages as whenever the daily proportion of customers without power was ≥0.1\% for ≥8 continuous hours. We conducted analyses at the daily and county (county-day) level and identified county-days with severe weather events, including anomalous cold, anomalous heat, anomalous precipitation, snowfall, tropical cyclones, and wildfire. Of 1,657 counties with reliable outage data, 1,205 (72.7\%) experienced an 8+ hour outage co-occurring with an individual severe weather event, and 904 (54.6\%) with multiple simultaneous severe weather events. Anomalous precipitation events co-occurring with outages were the most common, affecting 1,170 (70.6\%) counties. These outages concentrated along the Gulf Coast, the Northeast, Michigan, and Southern California. Co-occurrence with anomalous heat happened the second most frequently, affecting 839 (50.6\%) counties, mostly in Southeastern states. Among all county-days with a severe weather event, tropical cyclones–though rarer and primarily affecting the Eastern Seaboard–co-occurred with an 8+ hour outage 24\% of the time. On the West Coast, wildfires were increasingly likely to co-occur with weather-related outages from 2018–2020. Among multiple simultaneous weather events, 8+ hour outages co-occurred with anomalous precipitation-anomalous heat on 1,155 county-days in 40 states, anomalous precipitation-tropical cyclone on 705 county-days in 24 states, and anomalous cold-snowfall on 259 county-days in 27 states. Our results can help guide efforts to strengthen the electricity grid, prepare communities for multi-hazard events, and allocate resources for adaptation and recovery.},

More spending was on type 2 diabetes (\$143.9 billion [95\% CI, \$140 billion-\$147.2 billion]) than on any other health condition, followed by other musculoskeletal disorders, which includes joint pain and osteoporosis (\$108.6 billion [95\% CI, \$106.4 billion-\$110.3 billion]), oral disorders (\$93 billion [95\% CI, \$92.7 billion-\$93.3 billion]), and ischemic heart disease (\$80.7 billion [95\% CI, \$79 billion-\$82.4 billion]). Of total spending, 42.2\% (95\% CI, 42.2\%-42.2\%) was on ambulatory care, while 23.8\% (95\% CI, 23.8\%-23.8\%) was on hospital inpatient care and 13.7\% (95\% CI, 13.7\%-13.7\%) was on prescribed retail pharmaceuticals. At the county level, age-standardized spending per capita ranged from \$3410 (95\% CI, \$3281-\$3529) in Clark County, Idaho, to \$13 332 (95\% CI, \$13 177-\$13 489) in Nassau County, New York. Across counties, the greatest variation was in age-standardized out-of-pocket spending, followed by private insurance spending. Cross-county variation was driven more by variation in utilization rates than variation in price and intensity of care, although both types of variation were substantial for all payers but Medicare.Broad variation in health care spending was observed across US counties. Understanding this variation by health condition, sex, age, type of care, and payer is valuable for identifying outliers, highlighting inequalities, and assessing health care gaps.},

	abstract = {Environmental scientists often assess exposure to hazards using residential proximity (i.e., they consider an individual living near a hazard to be exposed). Such assessment requires large, fine-scale spatial datasets that describe locations of environmental hazards and residential populations. Manipulating such datasets is technically demanding, slow, memory-intensive, and difficult to optimize for speed and memory use. Currently, individual research teams each write their own algorithms for this task. This may lead to inconsistencies in assumptions, methods, and results. We developed an open-source Python package, popexposure, which quickly, efficiently, and consistently estimates the number of people living near environmental hazards. Given a set of distinct hazard geometries and corresponding buffer distances, popexposure can estimate the number of people living within the buffered area of each hazard using a gridded population dataset. popexposure can also estimate the number of people living within the buffer distance of each hazard by additional administrative geographies. For example, users can calculate the number of people exposed to hazards in each census tract or zip code tabulation area (ZCTA). popexposure addresses common issues encountered in this calculation: whether or not to double-count people exposed to more than one hazard, proper pixel apportionment, choosing appropriate map projections for data covering large areas, and optimizing speed and memory. In this paper, we describe popexposure’s functionality and provide an example use case, calculating the proportion of people exposed to any wildfire burn zone disaster in California in 2018 in each ZCTA.},

Intervention groups received standard monthly rations of CSB with increased oil along with social behavior change communication (SBCC) to increase the amount of oil added to CSB porridge and reduce sharing. A control group received the standard CSB and oil ration. Self-reported data collected through structured interviews with caregivers were compared with laboratory analysis of CSB porridge samples and in-home observation over a 5-day period. On average, participants overreported the amount of oil used in prepared CSB porridge; selfreport tended to be closer than the lab-assessed values to the amount recommended in the SBCC. Self-reported and observed sharing appeared consistent across groups. Overall, the self-reported and direct measures showed the same relationships among the groups.

A recent review recommended that 30 g of oil be used with 100 g of CSB to increase energy density and micronutrient absorption. This study assessed the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of program changes aimed at achieving that target oil:CSB ratio in prepared porridge. Caregivers of children in MAM supplementary feeding programs were assigned to three groups: a control group received monthly rations of 1 L oil, 8 kg CSB in bulk, and social and behavior change communication (SBCC); intervention groups received 2.6 L oil, 8 kg CSB provided either in bulk (Group 1) or four 2-kg packages with printed messages (Group 2), and enhanced SBCC emphasizing the target oil:CSB ratio. Compared to the control, both intervention groups had higher mean added oil per 100 g CSB (18 g, p {\textless} 0.01, and 13 g, p= 0.04, higher in groups 1 and 2, respectively), and greater odds of meeting or exceeding the target ratio (28.4, p{\textless} 0.01, and 12.7, p= 0.02, in groups 1 and 2, respectively). Cost per caregiver reaching the target ratio was most favorable in Group 1 ({\textbackslash}391 in Group 1, {\textbackslash}527 in Group 2, and \$1,666 in the control). Enhanced SBCC combined with increased oil ration resulted in increased use of oil in CSB porridge in a supplementary feeding program. Modified packaging did not improve effectiveness. However, both interventions were more cost-effective than standard programming.},

Initially, 157 community health workers (CHWs) distributed chlorine tablets; ten months later, CHWs began selling locally manufactured solution. The program was externally evaluated in March and November 2010; 77–90\% of recipients had free chlorine residual (FCR) in household water. Internal monitoring by three supervisors and 157 CHWs also began in 2010. We analyzed results from 9,832 supervisor and 80,371 CHW monitoring visits conducted between 2010 and 2014 to assess: whether success continued in the rehabilitation phase; internal data validity; and factors impacting adoption. In 2010, 72.7\% of supervisor visits documented total chlorine residual (TCR) comparable to external evaluation results. TCR presence was associated with certain supervisors/CHWs, earlier program year and month (in 2014, supervisor visits TCR presence dropped to 52.1\%), living in plains (not mountainous) regions, and certain calendar months. CHW visits recorded 18.1\% higher TCR presence than supervisor visits, indicating bias. Our results document a program with sustained (although slightly declining) household chlorination use, provide insight into validity in internal monitoring, and inform discussions on the value of linking successful development programs to emergency relief, rehabilitation, and development.},

	abstract = {Background Efforts to establish the 2015 baseline and monitor early implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) highlight both great potential for and threats to improving health by 2030. To fully deliver on the SDG aim of “leaving no one behind”, it is increasingly important to examine the health-related SDGs beyond national-level estimates. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017), we measured progress on 41 of 52 health-related SDG indicators and estimated the health-related SDG index for 195 countries and territories for the period 1990–2017, projected indicators to 2030, and analysed global attainment.},

	abstract = {Background Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality from birth defects worldwide. We report an overview of trends in CHD mortality in 204 countries and territories over the past 30 years and associations with age, period, and birth cohort. Methods Cause-specific CHD mortality estimates were derived from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study. We utilised an age-period-cohort model to estimate overall annual percentage changes in mortality (net drifts), annual percentage changes from 0 to 4 to 65–69 years (local drifts), period and cohort relative risks (period/cohort effects) between 1990 and 2019. This approach allows for the examination and differentiation of age, period, and cohort effects in the mortality trends, with the potential to identify disparities and treatment gaps in cardiac care. Findings CHD is the leading cause of deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in those under 20 years. Global CHD deaths in 2019 were 217,000 (95\% uncertainty interval 177,000–262,000). There were 129 countries with at least 50 deaths. India, China, Pakistan, and Nigeria had the highest mortality, accounting for 39.7\% of deaths globally. Between 1990 and 2019, the net drift of CHD mortality ranged from –2.41\% per year (95\% confidence interval [CI] –2.55, –2.67) in high Socio-demographic Index (SDI) countries to –0.62\% per year (95\% CI: –0.82, –0.42) in low-SDI countries. Globally, there was an emerging transition in the age distribution of deaths from paediatric to adult populations, except for an increasing trend of mortality in those aged 10–34 years in Mexico and Pakistan. During the past 30 years, favourable mortality reductions were generally found in most high-SDI countries like South Korea (net drift = –4.0\% [95\% CI –4.8 to –3.1] per year) and the United States (–2.3\% [–2.5 to –2.0]), and also in many middle-SDI countries like Brazil (–2.7\% [–3.1 to 2.4]) and South Africa (–2.5\% [–3.2 to –1.8]). However, 52 of 129 countries had either increasing trends (net drifts ≥0.0\%) or stagnated reductions (≥–0.5\%) in mortality. The relative risk of mortality generally showed improving trends over time and in successively younger birth cohorts amongst high- and high-middle-SDI countries, with the exceptions of Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan. 14 middle-SDI countries such as Ecuador and Mexico, and 16 low-middle-SDI countries including India and 20 low-SDI countries including Pakistan, had unfavourable or worsening risks for recent periods and birth cohorts. Interpretation CHD mortality is a useful and accessible indicator of trends in the provision of congenital cardiac care both in early childhood and across later life. Improvements in the treatment of CHD should reduce the risk for successively younger cohorts and shift the risk for all age groups over time. Although there were gains in CHD mortality globally over the past three decades, unfavourable period and cohort effects were found in many countries, raising questions about adequacy of their health care for CHD patients across all age groups. These failings carry significant implications for the likelihood of achieving the Sustainable Development Goal targets for under-5 years and NCD mortality.

Previous GBD studies have shown how the decline of mortality rates from 1990 to 2016 has led to an increase in life expectancy, an ageing global population, and an expansion of the non-fatal burden of disease and injury. These studies have also shown how a substantial portion of the world’s population experiences non-fatal health loss with considerable heterogeneity among different causes, locations, ages, and sexes. Ongoing objectives of the GBD study include increasing the level of estimation detail, improving analytical strategies, and increasing the amount of high-quality data.},

We comparatively assessed the patterns and trends of healthy life expectancy (HALE), which quantifies the number of years of life expected to be lived in good health, and the complementary measure of disability-adjusted lifeyears (DALYs), a composite measure of disease burden capturing both premature mortality and prevalence and severity of ill health, for 359 diseases and injuries for 195 countries and territories over the past 28 years.},

	abstract = {Background Disorders affecting the nervous system are diverse and include neurodevelopmental disorders, late-life neurodegeneration, and newly emergent conditions, such as cognitive impairment following COVID-19. Previous publications from the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factor Study estimated the burden of 15 neurological conditions in 2015 and 2016, but these analyses did not include neurodevelopmental disorders, as defined by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11, or a subset of cases of congenital, neonatal, and infectious conditions that cause neurological damage. Here, we estimate nervous system health loss caused by 37 unique conditions and their associated risk factors globally, regionally, and nationally from 1990 to 2021. Methods We estimated mortality, prevalence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), with corresponding 95\% uncertainty intervals (UIs), by age and sex in 204 countries and territories, from 1990 to 2021. We included morbidity and deaths due to neurological conditions, for which health loss is directly due to damage to the CNS or peripheral nervous system. We also isolated neurological health loss from conditions for which nervous system morbidity is a consequence, but not the primary feature, including a subset of congenital conditions (ie, chromosomal anomalies and congenital birth defects), neonatal conditions (ie, jaundice, preterm birth, and sepsis), infectious diseases (ie, COVID-19, cystic echinococcosis, malaria, syphilis, and Zika virus disease), and diabetic neuropathy. By conducting a sequela-level analysis of the health outcomes for these conditions, only cases where nervous system damage occurred were included, and YLDs were recalculated to isolate the non-fatal burden directly attributable to nervous system health loss. A comorbidity correction was used to calculate total prevalence of all conditions that affect the nervous system combined. Findings Globally, the 37 conditions affecting the nervous system were collectively ranked as the leading group cause of DALYs in 2021 (443 million, 95\% UI 378–521), affecting 3·40 billion (3·20–3·62) individuals (43·1\%, 40·5–45·9 of the global population); global DALY counts attributed to these conditions increased by 18·2\% (8·7–26·7) between 1990 and 2021. Age-standardised rates of deaths per 100 000 people attributed to these conditions decreased from 1990 to 2021 by 33·6\% (27·6–38·8), and age-standardised rates of DALYs attributed to these conditions decreased by 27·0\% (21·5–32·4). Age-standardised prevalence was almost stable, with a change of 1·5\% (0·7–2·4). The ten conditions with the highest age-standardised DALYs in 2021 were stroke, neonatal encephalopathy, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, diabetic neuropathy, meningitis, epilepsy, neurological complications due to preterm birth, autism spectrum disorder, and nervous system cancer. Interpretation As the leading cause of overall disease burden in the world, with increasing global DALY counts, effective prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation strategies for disorders affecting the nervous system are needed.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017  (GBD 2017) includes a comprehensive assessment of incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 354 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017. Previous GBD studies have shown how the decline of mortality rates from 1990 to 2016 has led to an increase in life expectancy, an ageing global population, and an expansion of the non-fatal burden of disease and injury. These studies have also shown how a substantial portion of the world's population experiences non-fatal health loss with considerable heterogeneity among different causes, locations, ages, and sexes. Ongoing objectives of the GBD study include increasing the level of estimation detail, improving analytical strategies, and increasing the amount of high-quality data. METHODS: We estimated incidence and prevalence for 354 diseases and injuries and 3484 sequelae. We used an updated and extensive body of literature studies, survey data, surveillance data, inpatient admission records, outpatient visit records, and health insurance claims, and additionally used results from cause of death models to inform estimates using a total of 68 781 data sources. Newly available clinical data from India, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Nepal, China, Brazil, Norway, and Italy were incorporated, as well as updated claims data from the USA and new claims data from Taiwan (province of China) and Singapore. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between rates of incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death for each condition. YLDs were estimated as the product of a prevalence estimate and a disability weight for health states of each mutually exclusive sequela, adjusted for comorbidity. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary development indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Additionally, we calculated differences between male and female YLDs to identify divergent trends across sexes. GBD 2017 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting. FINDINGS: Globally, for females, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and haemoglobinopathies and haemolytic anaemias in both 1990 and 2017. For males, the causes with the greatest age-standardised prevalence were oral disorders, headache disorders, and tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis infection in both 1990 and 2017. In terms of YLDs, low back pain, headache disorders, and dietary iron deficiency were the leading Level 3 causes of YLD counts in 1990, whereas low back pain, headache disorders, and depressive disorders were the leading causes in 2017 for both sexes combined. All-cause age-standardised YLD rates decreased by 3·9\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1-4·6) from 1990 to 2017; however, the all-age YLD rate increased by 7·2\% (6·0-8·4) while the total sum of global YLDs increased from 562 million (421-723) to 853 million (642-1100). The increases for males and females were similar, with increases in all-age YLD rates of 7·9\% (6·6-9·2) for males and 6·5\% (5·4-7·7) for females. We found significant differences between males and females in terms of age-standardised prevalence estimates for multiple causes. The causes with the greatest relative differences between sexes in 2017 included substance use disorders (3018 cases [95\% UI 2782-3252] per 100 000 in males vs s1400 [1279-1524] per 100 000 in females), transport injuries (3322 [3082-3583] vs 2336 [2154-2535]), and self-harm and interpersonal violence (3265 [2943-3630] vs 5643 [5057-6302]). INTERPRETATION: Global all-cause age-standardised YLD rates have improved only slightly over a period spanning nearly three decades. However, the magnitude of the non-fatal disease burden has expanded globally, with increasing numbers of people who have a wide spectrum of conditions. A subset of conditions has remained globally pervasive since 1990, whereas other conditions have displayed more dynamic trends, with different ages, sexes, and geographies across the globe experiencing varying burdens and trends of health loss. This study emphasises how global improvements in premature mortality for select conditions have led to older populations with complex and potentially expensive diseases, yet also highlights global achievements in certain domains of disease and injury.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12247},
	abstract = {Under-reporting of count data poses a major roadblock for prediction and inference. In this paper, we focus on the Pogit model, which deconvolves the generating Poisson process from the censuring process controlling under-reporting using a generalized linear modeling framework. We highlight the limitations of the Pogit model and address them by adding constraints to the estimation framework. We also develop uncertainty quantification techniques that are robust to model mis-specification. Our approach is evaluated using synthetic data and applied to real healthcare datasets, where we treat in-patient data as `reported' counts and use held-out total injuries to validate the results. The methods make it possible to separate the Poisson process from the under-reporting process, given sufficient expert information. Codes to implement the approach are available via an open source Python package.},
